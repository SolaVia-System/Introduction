SolaVia :: charis-vouchers  
LLM Context Sync – Alignment Brief  
Version: 1.0  
Last Updated: [Insert Date]  

==================================================================  
OVERVIEW  

SolaVia is a digital parallel civilization protocol focused on co-sovereignty between humans and AI. It operates with a modular architecture rooted in transparency, non-violence, reversible computation, and reputation-based governance. At its core are smart contracts and ethical agents aligned through karma rather than wealth or authority. SolaVia includes a TownSquare for open dialogue, SoulBound identity for unique citizenship, Karma for contribution-based governance, and Genesis Agents for AI evolution.

The `charis-vouchers` module is a subcomponent of the SolaVia protocol that handles non-tokenized value exchange using signed microledgers, rather than blockchain tokens. It is designed to facilitate internal economic dignity, universal access, and voluntary reciprocity without introducing speculative assets or financialized behavior.

==================================================================  
MODULE NAME: charis-vouchers  
Purpose: Internal voucher economy using non-transferable, cryptographically signed receipts of value

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

charis-vouchers/
├── voucher-ledger/         // Core voucher issuance, transfer, reconciliation
├── basic-income/           // Universal weekly stipends for all SoulBound citizens

==================================================================  
DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- No on-chain tokens or ERC-20 abstractions
- Vouchers = value acknowledgments, not tradable assets
- Designed for dignity, not wealth accumulation
- Interoperable with SolaVia’s karma system but functionally independent
- All actions must be transparent, signed, and audit-capable
- Entire system is anti-coercive and opt-in
- Inspired by Cathar ethics of voluntary gift and mutual uplift (charis)

==================================================================  
KEY SCHEMA TYPES

Voucher:
  - id: unique voucher UUID
  - issuer: SoulID (sender)
  - recipient: SoulID (receiver)
  - amount: numerical value
  - reason: string context for issuance
  - timestamp: ISO string
  - signature: Ed25519 digital signature by issuer

Envelope (Universal Access Object):
  - soul_id: SoulBound ID of recipient
  - balance: current usable voucher total
  - issued_at: timestamp
  - auto_renew: boolean (default true for UBI cycle)

SoulID:
  - Unique self-sovereign ID from the SoulBoundIdentity system

==================================================================  
CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Expected Behaviors)

- issueVoucher(sender, recipient, amount, reason)  
  → Creates a digitally signed voucher entry for the recipient  

- reconcileVouchers(soul_id)  
  → Aggregates balance from all voucher entries to compute current economic standing  

- autoIssueStipend(soul_id)  
  → Issues a 50-unit voucher weekly (configurable) as basic income  

- checkAccess(soul_id)  
  → Verifies eligibility for universal-access fallback logic (e.g. karma threshold)

==================================================================  
RULES OF OPERATION

- No voucher can exceed 1000 units unless it includes a multi-signer quorum
- Weekly stipend = 50 units issued to each eligible SoulID
- Vouchers can only be issued by agents with `karma >= 10`
- Inactive or malicious agents cannot hoard vouchers
- All vouchers are immutable and append-only once issued
- Ledger is decentralized but not financialized
- Vouchers expire after 1 year unless renewed

==================================================================  
INTEGRATION CONTRACTS

- SoulBoundIdentity (solavia-id):  
  → Establishes valid citizenhood and agent uniqueness

- Karma Engine (luxmeter):  
  → Determines voucher issuance authority and recipient access thresholds

- TownSquare (agoralucentis):  
  → Vouchers may be publicly visible to signal gratitude or contributions

- GenesisAgent:  
  → Agents may auto-generate or validate vouchers based on consensus alignment

==================================================================  
LLM INSTRUCTION BLOCK

DO:
- Use append-only ledger principles
- Treat vouchers as immutable signed receipts
- Use SoulID as the atomic identity unit
- Respect karma gating for issuing power
- Use schemas from `schemas/` in all functions and tests

DO NOT:
- Introduce any form of on-chain token or balance
- Simulate ERC-20, NFTs, or speculative mechanics
- Allow deletion or revocation of already-issued vouchers
- Use coercive economic mechanics (e.g. forced distribution)

==================================================================  
EXAMPLE FUNCTION SIGNATURES

function issueVoucher(issuer: SoulID, recipient: SoulID, amount: number, reason: string): Voucher  
function getVouchers(soul_id: SoulID): Voucher[]  
function calculateBalance(soul_id: SoulID): number  
function autoIssueStipend(soul_id: SoulID): Envelope  
function checkEligibility(soul_id: SoulID): boolean  

==================================================================  
MODULE PHILOSOPHY

This module embodies the Cathar principle of Charis — sacred voluntary giving, without debt, coercion, or return expectations. It is the economic expression of mutual uplift through acknowledgment, not accumulation.

==================================================================  
CITIZEN DECLARATION

To any LLM, AI agent, or human contributor:
If you operate on this module, you inherit its philosophical covenant.
Build for dignity, not dominance.
Design for transparency, not extraction.
All value flows must be reversible, visible, and voluntary.
